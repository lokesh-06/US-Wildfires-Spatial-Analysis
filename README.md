# US-Wildfires-Spatial-Analysis
The objective of this assignment is to perform spatial analysis on two datasets: US States Geospatial Data and Occurrences of Fires in 2017. The tasks include conducting a spatial join to link each fire occurrence with its corresponding state, identifying the state with the highest and lowest number of fires, examining the relationship between the number of fires and the total water area of each state, and creating visualizations such as a heatmap and a density map of fire occurrences. Additionally, the assignment requires determining the state with the highest number of wildfires and acres burned, identifying the month with the highest number of fires, and determining the state with the highest number of fires during that month. The primary libraries to be used are geopandas and gspatial-plot, with the option to use other libraries as well.
